CASES AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
Format: Case --> Expected
-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

----------------------------------
Local Functions:
----------------------------------
Configure:
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Negative-value arguments --> Error: can't have negatives
	Port is not a number --> Error
	IP Address Incorrect format --> Error
	Proper format for IP and  0 < port < 65536 --> .configure file will be created in same directory as ./WTF

Add:
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project name dne on client --> Error
	Project exists but filename doesn't --> File doesn't exist error
	Both project and file exists --> entry added to .Manifest. Old versions are replaced.

Remove: 
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project name dne on client --> Error
	Project exists but filename doesn't --> Nothing changes
	Both project and file exists --> Remove existing entry (should only be one, but all will be removed).
	No entry for existing file --> Nothing changes

----------------------------------
Non-Local Functions:
----------------------------------
NO CONFIGURE: --> If .configure doesn't exist, any function that makes contact with server will fail and exit. 
INVALID IP or PORT --> Client will report error and exit. 

Create:
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project name already exists on the server --> No project created, client notified.
	Client does't get a response from server --> Client will wait for some time, then stop waiting
	Project doesn't exist on server --> Directory created on server & client, with .Manifest (version:0)

Checkout:
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project does not exist on server --> Server will report it to client and process will end.
	Client already has project directory --> Client will report it and stop
	Project exists on server, not on client --> Server will send directory and all its contents

Update:
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project does not exist on server --> Server will report it to client and process will end.
	Manifest versions match --> Empty .Update is created on client
	Client and server have different Manifest versions:
		File's server/client version and stored hash are different, live hash matches client --> Add 'modify' line to .Update
		Server has file entries that client does not --> Write 'add' line to .Update
		Client has file entires the server doesn't --> Add 'delete' line to .Update
		Client hash is different from both Live hash and server's stored hash --> Add 'conflict' line to .Conflict, ask user to fix this

Upgrade: 
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project does not exist on server --> Server will report it to client and process will end.
	
Commit:
	Any arguments missing --> Program will stop with arguments missing message
	Project does not exist on server --> Server will report it to client and process will end.
	Client can't get servers .Manifest --> Error
